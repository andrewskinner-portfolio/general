Instructions://
-Run app.py on the command line with 'python app.py' and the scrape will take place by running scrape_mars.py which will then populate index.html//
-The flask app runs locally and can be accessed by copy-pasting the information provided on the command line into the browser address bar.//
-Pressing 'Scrape New Data' will then re-run the scrape_mars.py file.//
